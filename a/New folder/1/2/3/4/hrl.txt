i,

currently im doin a project to compare the content of 2 similar files. Im doing this project in Visual Studio using C# language. i have placed 2 "file field" from HTML component so that i can browse the files which i wan to compare. but the problem is i can't read the files even in the "file field" display my file directory. my second question is, how i wan do the comparison?? whats the method to do comparing 2 files?? can i have some example on how this action can be done??

with a click of a button it should run compare action and the result should display in a label in the same page. can it be done or i have to change any of the codes?? after the result displayed, i wan have a button to save the result as .txt file and at the same time on do an auto trigger mail which will send the result.txt to a specific person. how it can be done?  do advice me on this.

here is my non-completed source code:

private void Button1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{

result1.Text= "Check Complete"; // dispaly all the result in the box juz testing...

button2.Visible= true;Button3.Visible= true;
}

private void button2_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{

Response.Redirect("compare.aspx"); // to return to compare page

}

private void Button3_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{

}

 

*Button1 is to do comparing process and display the result in result1 label. what code i should write there??

*Button2 is to return to the original page

*Button3 is for save the result as .txt file and wan to set as an auto trigger mail to specific person wen tis button is clicked. what should i do ere?? what code i need to write...

hi vasanth,

related to ur source code, i have an error FileUpload1.FileBytes. same goes to FileUpload2.FileBytes.
actualy how the FileUpload1.FileBytes is linked?? im using Visual studio and i use the File field(under Toolbox > HTML)  to browse files. i didnt use the Web Form to browse files but for other button such as click button, label i use from toolbox > web form. so how i wan to make sure that my files are detected since i can't read the files. i juz only can display the directory of my files in the file field after i browse my files. how i need to modify this so that i can read the files and proceed to compare the strings of the file??

regards,

Nares

Hi,

try the below one...

Aspx

<input id="File1" type="file" runat="server"/>

<br />

<input id="File2" type="file" runat="server"/>

<br />

<br />

<asp:Button ID="Button1" runat="server" Text="Button" /></div>

Code Behind..

Protected Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
If File1.PostedFile.ContentLength > 0 And File2.PostedFile.ContentLength > 0 Then

Dim fileCon1(File1.PostedFile.ContentLength) As Byte

File1.PostedFile.InputStream.Read(fileCon1, 0, File1.PostedFile.ContentLength)

Dim fileCon2(File2.PostedFile.ContentLength) As Byte

File2.PostedFile.InputStream.Read(fileCon2, 0, File2.PostedFile.ContentLength)

Dim strContent1 As String = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(fileCon1)
Dim strContent2 As String = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(fileCon2)

If (strContent1.Equals(strContent2)) Then

Response.Write("Same")
Else

Response.Write("No")
End If

Else

Response.Write("Pelase provide necessary details")
End If

 

End Sub

byte[] fileCon1 = new byte[File1.PostedFile.ContentLength];byte[] fileCon2 = new byte[File2.PostedFile.ContentLength];
File1.PostedFile.InputStream.Read(fileCon1, 0, File1.PostedFile.ContentLength);

File2.PostedFile.InputStream.Read(fileCon2, 0, File2.PostedFile.ContentLength);

string strContent1 = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(fileCon1);

hi vasanth,

i have tried ur code but it shows error in the:

string strContent1 = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(fileCon1);

before this i post that i have error in the line:

string strContent1 = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(fileCon1);
string strContent2 = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(fileCon2);

with some research on net i fix the problem:

string strContent1 = System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetString(fileCon1);
string strContent2 = System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetString(fileCon2);

thank you very much on your help. i realy appreciate it. without you i can't finish it. thank you so much.

Nares...

Hi vasanth,

now im having multiple file to check its content but the problem is, it take time to select 1 file by 1 file to check its content. i find it not a user friendly if i wan to check contents of 10 files. its realy take time to compare 1 file vt another, i have to repeat this thing 10 times.

so for solution i thought wan do few copies of 'File Field' so that i can browse few files and do comparing at the same time. but i think its not that efficient, so i thought of , can we select a folder to do comparing??? if can, when we browse folders, it will check files inside the folder are the same with what we wan to compare then if it the same files exist, it will then compare the content of each files like you did before.

please advise me more on this. help needed on this.
