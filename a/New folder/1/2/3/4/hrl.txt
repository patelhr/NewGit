i,

currently im doin a project to compare the content of 2 similar files. Im doing this project in Visual Studio using C# language. i have placed 2 "file field" from HTML component so that i can browse the files which i wan to compare. but the problem is i can't read the files even in the "file field" display my file directory. my second question is, how i wan do the comparison?? whats the method to do comparing 2 files?? can i have some example on how this action can be done??

with a click of a button it should run compare action and the result should display in a label in the same page. can it be done or i have to change any of the codes?? after the result displayed, i wan have a button to save the result as .txt file and at the same time on do an auto trigger mail which will send the result.txt to a specific person. how it can be done?  do advice me on this.

here is my non-completed source code:

private void Button1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{

result1.Text= "Check Complete"; // dispaly all the result in the box juz testing...

button2.Visible= true;Button3.Visible= true;
}

private void button2_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{

Response.Redirect("compare.aspx"); // to return to compare page

}

private void Button3_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{

}

 

*Button1 is to do comparing process and display the result in result1 label. what code i should write there??

*Button2 is to return to the original page

*Button3 is for save the result as .txt file and wan to set as an auto trigger mail to specific person wen tis button is clicked. what should i do ere?? what code i need to write...

im realy new to programming and im stuck in writing C# code.

Hi,

below is the code to compare files....

string strContent1 = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(FileUpload1.FileBytes);
string strContent2 = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(FileUpload2.FileBytes);

if (strContent1 == strContent2)
{

Response.Write("Same");
}

else

{

Response.Write("No ya...");
}

contents present in file 1 but not present in file 2...(A-B)

string SQL1 ="SELECT file1 FROM testtable1 WHERE (file1 NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT file2 FROM testtable2))";SqlCommand cmd1 = new SqlCommand(SQL1,con);
con.Open();

SqlDataReader reader1 = cmd1.ExecuteReader();

if(reader1.Read())
{

DataGrid1.DataSource=reader1;

DataGrid1.DataBind();

}

con.Close();

 contents present in file 2 but not present in file 1...(B-A)

string SQL1 ="SELECT file2 FROM testtable2 WHERE (file2 NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT file1 FROM testtable1))";SqlCommand cmd1 = new SqlCommand(SQL1,con);
con.Open();

SqlDataReader reader1 = cmd1.ExecuteReader();

 

DataGrid1.DataSource=reader1;

DataGrid1.DataBind();

con.Close();
